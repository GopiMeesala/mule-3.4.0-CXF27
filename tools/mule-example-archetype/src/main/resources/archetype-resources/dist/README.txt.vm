Simply build the example and copy the packaged application to Mule's application
folder (${D}MULE_HOME/apps).

| Building the example |
+----------------------+
First, make sure you have set the MULE_HOME environment variable as recommended
in Mule's README.txt

Depending on the build tool you are using (Ant or Maven), you can build the example
by simply running "ant" or "mvn".  This will compile the example classes and produce
an application archive file.
